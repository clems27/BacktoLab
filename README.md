## Whats provided in these scaffolding files?

  * A docker setup which will provide you with node.js, mysql and phpmyadmin, including the configuration needed so that both node.js AND phpmyadmin can 'see' and connect to your mysql database.  If you don't use docker you'll have to set up and connect each of these components separately.
  * A basic starting file structure for a node.js app.
  * A package.json file that will pull in the node.js libraries required and start your app as needed.
  * A db.js file which provides all the code needed to connect to the mysql database, using the credentials in the .env file, and which provides a query() function that can send queries to the database and receive a result.  In order to use this (ie. interact with the database, you simply need to include this file in any file you create that needs this database interaction) with the following code:

```const db = require('./services/db');
```

____

Useful commands:

Get a shell in any of the containers

```bash
docker exec -it <container name> bash -l
```

Once in the database container, you can get a MySQL CLI in the usual way

```bash
mysql -uroot -p<password> 
```
